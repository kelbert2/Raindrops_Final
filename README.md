Raindrops_Final
===============

This is an attempt to upload my finished raindrop game. The name is like this for that reason. It is a new repository and probably will not show any work.

Here is my readMe from Raindrops:

Raindrops
=========
Try to catch the falling raindrops by moving the catcher with your mouse.
Every missed raindrop causes the water level to rise, and if it fills almost half the screen (the 200 mark), a shark swims by and the game is lost. You may enter a lightning round with a whole load of drops by double clicking any key.
To win, catch 25 raindrops.

Bugs:
When you catch a drop or it falls into the rising puddle, the other drops may change size and transparency, which relies on their size.
When the shark swims by, the dorsal fin widens and a shadow-like shape follows him.
The drops may not fall according to a one second interval, and the game does not restart, but the drops will all come down at once.
